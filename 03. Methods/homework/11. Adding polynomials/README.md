# Adding polynomials

## Description
Write a method that adds two polynomials.
Represent them as arrays of their coefficients.
Write a program that reads two polynomials and prints their sum.

## Input
- On the first line you will receive the number **N**
- On the second line you will receive the first polynomial as coefficients separated by spaces
- On the third line you will receive the second polynomial as coefficients separated by spaces

## Output
- Print the sum of the polynomials

## Constraints
- 1 <= **N** <= 1024
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **8MB**

## Sample tests

_Example:_

x<sup>2</sup> + 5 = `1`x<sup>2</sup> + `0`x + `5`	=>	{`5`, `0`, `1`}
